DESCRIPTION

Simplify is a dictionary frontend application that tries to steamline
your dictionary searching and browsing experience.

FEATURES

 * Simplify supports Inline Word Search which means you can put cursor
   over a word, press a hotkey and dictionary article will pop out right
   under the mouse cursor.
 * Inline Word Search integration with Mozilla Firefox.
 * Inline Word Search integration with GTK+ applications.
 * Support for EPWING dictionaries.
 * Dictionary articles can be formatted by using built-in JavaScript
   engine before being displayed on the screen.

KNOWN ISSUES

 * Inline word search is known to not work in Qt applications because
   Qt doesn't have an infrastructure required to implement the feature.
